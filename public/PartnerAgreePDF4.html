<h6>2. SIM Cards</h6>
<ol>
  <li>
    The Partner is responsible for maintaining a sufficient number of SIM Cards
    to meet the Partner’s reasonably anticipated demand.
  </li>
  <li>
    Title to SIM Cards (including software in the SIM Cards) shall remain with
    Plan or a third-party provider, where not owned by Plan, as applicable, at
    all times.
  </li>
  <li>
    Subject to the availability of SIM Cards, Plan will supply the Partner with
    the quantity of SIM Cards which Plan agrees with the Partner from time to
    time following a request from the Partner. Subject to paragraph 2.4, SIM
    Cards will be issued free of charge by Plan to the Partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan may invoice the Partner for the reasonable cost of SIM Cards if the SIM
    Cards are:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Not activated and showing normal levels of usage within a reasonable
        period of time following issue (as may be determined by Plan, but no
        longer than a period of six (6) months or such longer period as the
        Parties may agree);
      </li>
      <li>
        In Plan’s reasonable opinion, unlikely to be used as anticipated under
        the Agreement or are showing unusually high or low levels of usage; or
      </li>
      <li>Lost or damaged after delivery to the Partner,</li>
    </ol>
    and Plan may also charge the Partner for the cost of delivery of the SIM
    Cards.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan shall deliver the SIM Cards to the Partner at the delivery address
    specified in the Order. Delivery shall be deemed to have occurred when the
    SIM Cards are received at the delivery address. Risk of loss or damage to
    SIM Cards will remain with Plan until they are delivered to the delivery
    address.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan does not accept any liability for any delay in delivery of the SIM
    Cards.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a Partner can demonstrate to Plan’s satisfaction (acting reasonably) that
    the SIM Cards have been lost or damaged in transit before delivery, Plan may
    replace the lost or damaged SIM Cards free of charge, provided that the
    Partner has notified Plan and the carrier in the case of damaged SIM Cards
    within three (3) days of delivery or within five (5) days of the expected
    delivery date in the case of lost SIM Cards.
  </li>
  <li>
    To the extent the SIM Cards are not checked on delivery, the Partner must
    endorse the carrier’s documentation as "unexamined".
  </li>
</ol>
<h6>3. Gateways</h6>
<ol>
  <li>
    The Partner shall not connect Gateways to the Network or use Gateways or
    otherwise provide telecommunications services to a third party or allow any
    Customer to do the same without Plan’s prior written consent which Plan can
    withhold in Plan’s absolute discretion according to Plan’s Gateway Policy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner agrees to follow Plan’s instructions to facilitate the
    disconnection of any Gateway that breaches the Applicable Laws or Plan’s
    Gateway Policy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall promptly provide to Plan in writing all technical
    particulars of the Gateway, Customer Information and its use which Plan may
    request if Plan believes the Customer has established, installed or is using
    a Gateway or if the Partner becomes aware that any Customer or any other
    party has established, installed or is using a Gateway.
  </li>
  <li>
    If Plan has proof that the Partner and/or a Customer has used a Gateway,
    Plan may suspend and/or disconnect SIM Cards in the Gateway without further
    notice to the Partner and/or the Customer.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    If the Partner does not use any IOT SIM dispatched to it within five (5)

  </li>
  <li>
    Plan reserves the right by giving notice to the Partner at any time before
    delivery, to increase the price of the Equipment to reflect any increase in
    the cost to Plan which is due to any factor beyond the control of Plan, any
    change in delivery dates, quantities, or specifications for Equipment which
    is requested by the Partner, or any delay caused by instructions of the
    Partner or failure of the Partner to give Plan accurate or timely
    information or instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Partner and Plan, the Partner
    shall be liable to pay Plan’s charges for transport, packaging, and
    insurance in respect of delivery of the Equipment. All prices are exclusive

  </li>
  <li>
    All amounts payable under these Equipment Terms are exclusive of value-added

  </li>
  <li>
    Save as may have otherwise been agreed by Plan and the Partner in writing in
    accordance with the terms of any credit account authorised by Plan for the
    Partner from time to time, the Partner shall pay the price of the Equipment
    not later than 14 days following the date of the invoice relating to the
    Equipment. The time of payment shall be of the essence of each Equipment
    Contract. All payments shall be made in full without deduction in respect of
    any set-off or counterclaim.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Partner fails to make any payment to Plan on the due date then
    without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Plan, Plan shall
    be entitled to:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cancel each and any unperformed or part-performed Equipment Contracts
        between Plan and the Partner and/or suspend any further deliveries of
        Equipment to the Partner;
      </li>
      <li>
        Appropriate any payment made by the Partner to such of the Equipment (or
        the goods supplied under any other contract between the Partner and
        Plan) as Plan may think fit (notwithstanding any purported appropriation
        by the Partner); and
      </li>
      <li>
        Charge the Partner interest (both before and after any judgment) on the
        amount unpaid, at the rate equivalent to that set out in section 6 of
        the Late Payments of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 (such interest
        being deemed to accrue day to day from the due date and being compounded
        on the last day of each calendar month) until payment is made.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan may at any time set off any liability of the Partner to Plan howsoever
    arising and whether such liability is present or future. Any exercise of
    Plan’s rights under this clause shall be without prejudice to any other
    rights or remedies available to Plan under an Equipment Contract or the
    Agreement.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>5. Delivery</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    Delivery of the Equipment shall be made to the place for delivery in the
    United Kingdom agreed between Plan and the Partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan shall endeavour to deliver the Equipment by the date quoted for
    delivery but such date is not guaranteed nor shall the time for delivery be
    of the essence. The date quoted for delivery shall be extended by a
    reasonable period if there is any delay caused by industrial dispute or by
    any cause beyond the reasonable control of Plan. The Equipment may be
    delivered by Plan in advance of the quoted delivery date upon giving
    reasonable notice to the Partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Where the Equipment is to be delivered in instalments, each delivery shall
    constitute a separate contract and failure by Plan to deliver any one or
    more of the instalments in accordance with these Equipment Terms or any
    claim by the Partner in respect of any one or more instalments shall not
    entitle the Partner to treat any Equipment Contract as a whole as
    repudiated.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Partner fails to take delivery of the Equipment or fails to give Plan
    adequate delivery instructions, documents, licences, consents or
    authorisations at the time stated for delivery (otherwise than by reason of
    any cause beyond the Partner’s reasonable control or by reason of Plan’s
    fault) that are required to enable the Equipment to be delivered then
    without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Plan, Plan may:
    <ol>
      <li>
        store the Equipment until actual delivery and charge the Partner for the
        reasonable costs (including insurance) of storage; or
      </li>
      <li>
        sell the Equipment at the best price readily obtainable and (after
        deducting all reasonable storage and selling expenses) account to the
        Partner for the excess over the price under the relevant Equipment
        Contract or charge the Partner for any shortfall below the price under
        that Equipment Contract.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    If Plan fails to deliver the Equipment or any part thereof on the delivery
    date specified in the Equipment Contract (other than for reasons outside
    Plan’s reasonable control or the Partner’s or its carrier’s fault):
    <ol>
      <li>
        but Plan then delivers the Equipment at any time thereafter, Plan shall
        have no liability in respect of such late delivery; or
      </li>
      <li>
        but the Partner then gives written notice to Plan of the failed
        delivery, within 7 days after such delivery date and Plan fails to
        deliver the Equipment within 30 days after receiving such notice, the
        Partner may cancel the order and neither the Partner nor Plan shall have
        any further liability in respect thereof.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>6. Risk and Property</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    Risk of damage to or loss of the Equipment shall pass to the Partner at the
    time of delivery or, if the Partner wrongfully fails to take delivery of the
    Equipment, the time when Plan has tendered delivery of the Equipment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Notwithstanding delivery and the passing of risk in the Equipment, or any
    other provision of an Equipment Contract, the property in the Equipment
    shall not pass to the Partner until Plan has received payment in full of the
    price of the Equipment and all other goods agreed to be sold by Plan to the
    Partner for which payment is then due. Such payment being effected by cash,
    cleared funds, or set-off under the terms of the Agreement.
  </li>
  <li>
    Until such time as the property in the Equipment passes to the Partner, the
    Partner shall:
    <ol>
      <li>Hold the Equipment as Plan’s fiduciary agent and bailee;</li>
      <li>
        Keep the Equipment separate from those of the Partner’s and third
        parties and properly stored, protected, insured, and identified as
        Plan’s property; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Be entitled to resell or use the Equipment in the ordinary course of the
        Partner’s business (unless Plan revokes such entitlement), provided
        always that in the event that the Partner sells or transfers any
        Equipment supplied by Plan to a third party before legal and beneficial
        title in such Equipment has passed to the Partner under these Equipment
        Terms, the proceeds of the sub-sale or transfer (or such proportion as
        is due to Plan in relation to the Equipment sold) shall be held by the
        Partner on Plan’s behalf and delivered up by the Partner to Plan
        immediately upon demand. The Partner’s right to sell or transfer any
        Equipment supplied by Plan to a third party before legal and beneficial
        title in such Equipment has passed to the Partner under these Equipment
        Terms shall automatically cease and terminate upon the Partner breaching
        any terms of these Equipment Terms and/or the Agreement (including the
        occurrence of any Insolvency Event).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Until such time as the property in the Equipment passes to the Partner (and
    provided that the Equipment is still in existence and has not been resold),
    Plan shall be entitled:
    <ol>
      <li>
        On three days’ notice to the Partner, to enter upon any premises where
        the Equipment is stored to inspect them; and
      </li>
      <li>
        At any time to require the Partner to deliver up the Equipment to Plan
        and, if the Partner fails to do so immediately, to enter upon any
        premises of the Partner or any third party where the Equipment is stored
        and repossess the Equipment.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall not be entitled to pledge or in any way charge by way of
    security for any indebtedness any of the Equipment which remains the
    property of Plan, but if the Partner does so, all monies owing by the
    Partner to Plan shall (without prejudice to any other right or remedy of
    Plan) immediately become due and payable.
  </li>
  <li>
    The provisions set out in this clause shall be without prejudice to the
    Partner’s obligation to purchase the Equipment. Plan shall have the right to
    commence debt recovery and other legal proceedings to recover any sum
    outstanding from the Partner to Plan notwithstanding the provisions of this
    clause 6.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>7. Warranties and Notifications of Claims</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    The Partner must inspect the Equipment at the time of its delivery or
    collection (as the case may be). Any claim for non-delivery (including, but
    not limited to, short shipment, transit damage, or dead on arrival) of any
    Equipment shall be notified in writing by the Partner to Plan within
    twenty-four hours of delivery. Subject to clause 19 of the Agreement, Plan
    shall be under no liability for any damage or shortages that would be
    apparent on reasonable careful inspection if the provisions of this clause 7
    are not complied with and, in any event, will be under no liability if a
    written complaint is not delivered to Plan within 24 hours of delivery
    detailing the alleged damage or shortage. In all cases where the Partner
    complains of defects or shortages, Plan shall be under no liability in
    respect thereof unless an opportunity to inspect the Equipment is supplied
    to Plan before any use is made of the Equipment or if any alteration or
    modification is made to the Equipment by the Partner. Subject to the
    remainder of this clause 7 and to clause 20 of the Agreement, Plan shall
    make good any shortage in the Equipment and where appropriate replace any
    Equipment damaged in transit as soon as it is reasonable to do so, but
    otherwise shall be under no liability whatsoever arising from such shortage
    or damage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any claim which is based on any defect in the quality or condition of the
    Equipment shall (whether or not delivery is refused by the Partner) be
    notified to Plan within 10 days from the date of delivery to the Customer
    (or as otherwise specified in Plan’s returns policy from time to time). If
    the Equipment develops a fault or other defect within 10 days of the date of
    their delivery to the Customer, the Partner must:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Inform Plan providing full details of the fault or defect within that
        ten-day (10) period.
      </li>
      <li>
        Comply with the provisions of clause 7 (and where applicable clause 8),
        and in so doing give Plan (and, if relevant, the manufacturer of the
        Equipment in question) a reasonable period of time to inspect and
        examine the Equipment to determine if it is faulty or defective in any
        way.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a fault in any Equipment becomes apparent after the date that is 10
        days after the date of delivery of the Equipment to the Customer, then
        the Partner must rely on the terms of any manufacturer’s warranty that

      <li>
        Customer or end user’s negligence and/or failure to follow Plan’s or

      <li>
        Any Equipment returned by the Partner to Plan which is alleged to have

        (or their authorised agents, employees, or contractors), are determined
        by such person(s), in their absolute discretion, not to be faulty or

    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    If Plan has replaced Equipment pursuant to clause 7.4 and the Equipment

    and advertisement of the Equipment and shall not make any written statement
    as to the quality or manufacture of the Equipment without the prior written
    approval of Plan. The Partner will indemnify Plan against any liability loss
    or damage which Plan might suffer as a result of the Partner’s failure to
