<h6>2. Use of the Service</h6>
<ol>
  <li>
    The Partner must take reasonable steps to ensure that the Service is not
    used:
    <ol>
      <li>
        unlawfully or fraudulently or in breach of any legislation including but
        not limited to any in breach of Plan’s Gateway Policy; or
      </li>
      <li>
        in any way that infringes the Intellectual Property Rights of Plan; or
      </li>
      <li>
        contrary to any instructions which Plan issues for reasons of health,
        safety or the quality of the Service or the quality of any other
        telecommunications services provided, and it is the Partner’s
        responsibility to ensure these are adhered to.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Partner is aware or reasonably suspects that the Customer is using or
    has used the IOT Service for any of the purposes listed above, then the
    Partner undertakes and agrees to notify Plan immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner acknowledges that in the event that the Customer is using or has
    used the IOT Service for any of the purposes listed above, Plan may,
    following reasonable notice, disconnect the IOT Service.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall co-operate with Plan in relation to any complaints,
    enquiries, or investigations regarding the IOT Service.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner agrees to notify Plan immediately in the event that it becomes
    aware of any fault in the IOT Service of any Customer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan may suspend the IOT Service in the event that and for so long as, the
    Customer is in material breach of its Customer Contract (including failure
    to pay any sum due) and shall have failed to remedy such breach following
    the expiration of any notice requiring it to do so.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan may suspend all or any part of the IOT Service without prior notice:
    <ol>
      <li>
        in the event that it wishes to carry out maintenance, upgrade works or
        back-ups (in which case Plan will use all reasonable endeavours to
        minimise the duration of the suspension and also to inform the Partner
        and Customer in advance of the suspension);
      </li>
      <li>
        to the extent necessary to prevent or restrict the incidence of any
        Fraud or other illegal activity in connection with the IOT Service;
      </li>
      <li>
        to the extent necessary to comply with an order or direction of Ofcom or
        any other competent regulatory or law enforcement authority;
      </li>
      <li>
        if there is a material and immediate threat to Plan’s network integrity.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan shall not be liable to the Partner and/or any Customer with respect to

    coverage gap or any IOT Service interruption (planned or otherwise).
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan shall not be liable to the Partner and/or any Customer with respect to
    any claim or damage suffered as a result of a visited public mobile network
    blocking the roaming service to SIMs supplied as part of the IOT Service.
  </li>
  <li>
    Charges are based on the assumption that the majority of traffic uses Plan’s
    preferred networks, UK or globally. If the traffic usage pattern varies
    significantly from this, Plan reserves the right to review pricing.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Partner does not use any IOT SIM dispatched to it within five (5)
    months from dispatch, Plan may require those SIMs to be returned to Plan and
    Plan may (at its sole discretion) choose to charge the Partner for any
    reasonable costs incurred.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner undertakes with Plan that throughout the Duration it will, and
    will take all reasonable steps to ensure that its employees will:
    <ol>
      <li>
        store any SIMs it receives prior to activation in a suitable manner to
        ensure that the SIMs are not harmed or damaged in any way;
      </li>
      <li>
        ensure, via comprehensive testing or some equivalently comprehensive
        means, that the SIMs provided by Plan are compatible with the Telematics
        Devices with which they are to be used;
      </li>
      <li>
        ensure that a reasonable level of testing is performed on SIMs from each
        batch of SIMs delivered to the Partner prior to the incorporation of
        that batch of SIMs in telematics devices;
      </li>
      <li>
        fully co-operate with Plan and comply with all reasonable instructions
        from Plan in respect of the IOT Service to ensure that the Mobile
        Communications Services do not interfere with, or adversely affect the
        operation of the electronic communications network or the provision of
        services to any other customers of Plan’s preferred Network Operator.
        Failure to comply with this paragraph may lead to the IOT Service being
        suspended.

    <ol>
      <li>
        the Partner’s Order has been accepted and confirmed in writing
        (including via the Portal) by Plan; or
      </li>
      <li>
        by processing the order for delivery (each such order when so confirmed

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

    No Order which has been accepted by Plan may be cancelled by the Partner
    except with the agreement in writing of Plan and on terms that the Partner

    charges, and expenses incurred by Plan as a result of cancellation.
  </li>
  <li>
    No variation of these Equipment Terms shall be binding on the parties unless
    agreed in writing between the authorised representative of Plan and the

  <li>
    The Partner shall be responsible to Plan for ensuring the accuracy of the
    terms of any Equipment Order submitted by the Partner and for giving Plan
    any necessary information relating to the Equipment within a sufficient time
    to enable Plan to perform an Equipment Contract in accordance with its
    terms.

</ol>

<h5>3. Price of the Equipment</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    Unless otherwise agreed in writing between Plan and the Partner, the price
    of the Equipment shall be Plan’s quoted price or, where no price has been
    quoted, the price listed in Plan’s published price list current at the date
    of acceptance of the order by Plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan reserves the right by giving notice to the Partner at any time before
    delivery, to increase the price of the Equipment to reflect any increase in
    the cost to Plan which is due to any factor beyond the control of Plan, any
    change in delivery dates, quantities, or specifications for Equipment which
    is requested by the Partner, or any delay caused by instructions of the
    Partner or failure of the Partner to give Plan accurate or timely
    information or instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Partner and Plan, the Partner
    shall be liable to pay Plan’s charges for transport, packaging, and
    insurance in respect of delivery of the Equipment. All prices are exclusive
    of such charges.
  </li>
  <li>
    All amounts payable under these Equipment Terms are exclusive of value-added
    tax or other sales tax, which shall be paid at the prevailing rate.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>4. Payment Terms</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    Plan shall be entitled to invoice the Partner with the price of the
    Equipment on or at any time after acceptance of the Partner’s order of the
    Equipment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Save as may have otherwise been agreed by Plan and the Partner in writing in
    accordance with the terms of any credit account authorised by Plan for the
    Partner from time to time, the Partner shall pay the price of the Equipment
    not later than 14 days following the date of the invoice relating to the
    Equipment. The time of payment shall be of the essence of each Equipment
    Contract. All payments shall be made in full without deduction in respect of
    any set-off or counterclaim.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Partner fails to make any payment to Plan on the due date then
    without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Plan, Plan shall
    be entitled to:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cancel each and any unperformed or part-performed Equipment Contracts
        between Plan and the Partner and/or suspend any further deliveries of
        Equipment to the Partner;
      </li>
      <li>
        Appropriate any payment made by the Partner to such of the Equipment (or
        the goods supplied under any other contract between the Partner and
        Plan) as Plan may think fit (notwithstanding any purported appropriation
        by the Partner); and
      </li>
      <li>
        Charge the Partner interest (both before and after any judgment) on the
        amount unpaid, at the rate equivalent to that set out in section 6 of
        the Late Payments of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 (such interest
        being deemed to accrue day to day from the due date and being compounded
        on the last day of each calendar month) until payment is made.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan may at any time set off any liability of the Partner to Plan howsoever
    arising and whether such liability is present or future. Any exercise of
    Plan’s rights under this clause shall be without prejudice to any other
    rights or remedies available to Plan under an Equipment Contract or the
    Agreement.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>5. Delivery</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    Delivery of the Equipment shall be made to the place for delivery in the
    United Kingdom agreed between Plan and the Partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan shall endeavour to deliver the Equipment by the date quoted for
    delivery but such date is not guaranteed nor shall the time for delivery be
    of the essence. The date quoted for delivery shall be extended by a
    reasonable period if there is any delay caused by industrial dispute or by
    any cause beyond the reasonable control of Plan. The Equipment may be
    delivered by Plan in advance of the quoted delivery date upon giving
    reasonable notice to the Partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Where the Equipment is to be delivered in instalments, each delivery shall
    constitute a separate contract and failure by Plan to deliver any one or
    more of the instalments in accordance with these Equipment Terms or any
    claim by the Partner in respect of any one or more instalments shall not
    entitle the Partner to treat any Equipment Contract as a whole as
    repudiated.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Partner fails to take delivery of the Equipment or fails to give Plan
    adequate delivery instructions, documents, licences, consents or
    authorisations at the time stated for delivery (otherwise than by reason of
    any cause beyond the Partner’s reasonable control or by reason of Plan’s
    fault) that are required to enable the Equipment to be delivered then
    without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Plan, Plan may:
    <ol>
      <li>
        store the Equipment until actual delivery and charge the Partner for the
        reasonable costs (including insurance) of storage; or
      </li>
      <li>
        sell the Equipment at the best price readily obtainable and (after
        deducting all reasonable storage and selling expenses) account to the
        Partner for the excess over the price under the relevant Equipment
        Contract or charge the Partner for any shortfall below the price under
        that Equipment Contract.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    If Plan fails to deliver the Equipment or any part thereof on the delivery
    date specified in the Equipment Contract (other than for reasons outside
    Plan’s reasonable control or the Partner’s or its carrier’s fault):
    <ol>
      <li>
        but Plan then delivers the Equipment at any time thereafter, Plan shall
        have no liability in respect of such late delivery; or
      </li>
      <li>
        but the Partner then gives written notice to Plan of the failed
        delivery, within 7 days after such delivery date and Plan fails to
        deliver the Equipment within 30 days after receiving such notice, the
        Partner may cancel the order and neither the Partner nor Plan shall have
        any further liability in respect thereof.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>6. Risk and Property</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    Risk of damage to or loss of the Equipment shall pass to the Partner at the
    time of delivery or, if the Partner wrongfully fails to take delivery of the
    Equipment, the time when Plan has tendered delivery of the Equipment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Notwithstanding delivery and the passing of risk in the Equipment, or any
    other provision of an Equipment Contract, the property in the Equipment
    shall not pass to the Partner until Plan has received payment in full of the
    price of the Equipment and all other goods agreed to be sold by Plan to the
    Partner for which payment is then due. Such payment being effected by cash,
    cleared funds, or set-off under the terms of the Agreement.
  </li>
  <li>
    Until such time as the property in the Equipment passes to the Partner, the
    Partner shall:
    <ol>
      <li>Hold the Equipment as Plan’s fiduciary agent and bailee;</li>
      <li>
        Keep the Equipment separate from those of the Partner’s and third
        parties and properly stored, protected, insured, and identified as
        Plan’s property; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Be entitled to resell or use the Equipment in the ordinary course of the
        Partner’s business (unless Plan revokes such entitlement), provided
        always that in the event that the Partner sells or transfers any
        Equipment supplied by Plan to a third party before legal and beneficial
        title in such Equipment has passed to the Partner under these Equipment
        Terms, the proceeds of the sub-sale or transfer (or such proportion as
        is due to Plan in relation to the Equipment sold) shall be held by the
        Partner on Plan’s behalf and delivered up by the Partner to Plan
        immediately upon demand. The Partner’s right to sell or transfer any
        Equipment supplied by Plan to a third party before legal and beneficial
        title in such Equipment has passed to the Partner under these Equipment
        Terms shall automatically cease and terminate upon the Partner breaching
        any terms of these Equipment Terms and/or the Agreement (including the
        occurrence of any Insolvency Event).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Until such time as the property in the Equipment passes to the Partner (and
    provided that the Equipment is still in existence and has not been resold),
    Plan shall be entitled:
    <ol>
      <li>
        On three days’ notice to the Partner, to enter upon any premises where
        the Equipment is stored to inspect them; and
      </li>
      <li>
        At any time to require the Partner to deliver up the Equipment to Plan
        and, if the Partner fails to do so immediately, to enter upon any
        premises of the Partner or any third party where the Equipment is stored
        and repossess the Equipment.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall not be entitled to pledge or in any way charge by way of
    security for any indebtedness any of the Equipment which remains the
    property of Plan, but if the Partner does so, all monies owing by the
    Partner to Plan shall (without prejudice to any other right or remedy of
    Plan) immediately become due and payable.
  </li>
  <li>
    The provisions set out in this clause shall be without prejudice to the
    Partner’s obligation to purchase the Equipment. Plan shall have the right to
    commence debt recovery and other legal proceedings to recover any sum
    outstanding from the Partner to Plan notwithstanding the provisions of this
    clause 6.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>7. Warranties and Notifications of Claims</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    The Partner must inspect the Equipment at the time of its delivery or
    collection (as the case may be). Any claim for non-delivery (including, but
    not limited to, short shipment, transit damage, or dead on arrival) of any
    Equipment shall be notified in writing by the Partner to Plan within
    twenty-four hours of delivery. Subject to clause 19 of the Agreement, Plan
    shall be under no liability for any damage or shortages that would be
    apparent on reasonable careful inspection if the provisions of this clause 7
    are not complied with and, in any event, will be under no liability if a
    written complaint is not delivered to Plan within 24 hours of delivery
    detailing the alleged damage or shortage. In all cases where the Partner
    complains of defects or shortages, Plan shall be under no liability in
    respect thereof unless an opportunity to inspect the Equipment is supplied
    to Plan before any use is made of the Equipment or if any alteration or
    modification is made to the Equipment by the Partner. Subject to the
    remainder of this clause 7 and to clause 20 of the Agreement, Plan shall
    make good any shortage in the Equipment and where appropriate replace any
    Equipment damaged in transit as soon as it is reasonable to do so, but
    otherwise shall be under no liability whatsoever arising from such shortage
    or damage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any claim which is based on any defect in the quality or condition of the
    Equipment shall (whether or not delivery is refused by the Partner) be
    notified to Plan within 10 days from the date of delivery to the Customer
    (or as otherwise specified in Plan’s returns policy from time to time). If
    the Equipment develops a fault or other defect within 10 days of the date of
    their delivery to the Customer, the Partner must:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Inform Plan providing full details of the fault or defect within that
        ten-day (10) period.
      </li>
      <li>
        Comply with the provisions of clause 7 (and where applicable clause 8),
        and in so doing give Plan (and, if relevant, the manufacturer of the
        Equipment in question) a reasonable period of time to inspect and
        examine the Equipment to determine if it is faulty or defective in any
        way.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a fault in any Equipment becomes apparent after the date that is 10
        days after the date of delivery of the Equipment to the Customer, then
        the Partner must rely on the terms of any manufacturer’s warranty that
        applies to the Equipment and Plan shall have no liability in respect of
        any such fault or defect.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    If delivery is not refused, and the Partner does not notify Plan of any
    claim in accordance with clauses 7.1 and/or 7.2 (as the case may be), the
    Partner shall not be entitled to reject the Equipment and Plan shall have no
    liability for such defects or failure, and the Partner shall be bound to pay
    the price as if the Equipment had been delivered in accordance with the
    relevant Equipment Contract.
  </li>
  <li>
    Where any valid claim in respect of any of the Equipment which is based on
    any defect in the quality or condition of the Equipment is notified to Plan
    in accordance with clause 7.2, Plan shall, at its sole discretion, replace
    the Equipment (or the part in question) free of charge within a reasonable
    period or refund to the Partner the price of the Equipment (or a
    proportionate part of the price) but Plan shall have no further liability to
    the Partner.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan shall be under no liability in respect of:
    <ol>
      <li>Any defect arising from fair wear and tear.</li>
      <li>
        Any wilful damage caused by the Partner or any third party (or their
        respective agents, sub-contractors, or employees).
      </li>
      <li>
        Customer or end user’s negligence and/or failure to follow Plan’s or
        manufacturer’s instructions (whether given orally or in writing).
      </li>
      <li>
        Customer or end user’s misuse or alteration of the Equipment without
        Plan’s prior written approval.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any other act or omission on the part of the Partner or the Customer or
        end user, their respective employees or agents.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any Equipment returned by the Partner to Plan which is alleged to have
        been faulty and/or defective in any way (“Alleged Faulty Good(s)”) but
        following testing and/or inspection by Plan or the relevant manufacturer
        (or their authorised agents, employees, or contractors), are determined
        by such person(s), in their absolute discretion, not to be faulty or
        defective in any way (a “No Fault Found Return”).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    If Plan has replaced Equipment pursuant to clause 7.4 and the Equipment
    which has been replaced is found subsequently to be a “No Fault Found
    Return”, Plan shall be entitled to charge the Partner the following costs:
    <ol>
      <li>
        The price of any replacement Equipment provided pursuant to clause 7.4.
      </li>
      <li>Delivery cost.</li>
      <li>An administration charge of £20.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall be entitled to the benefit of any warranty or guarantee as
    is given by the manufacturer to Plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Subject as expressly provided in these Equipment Terms all warranties
    conditions or other terms implied by statute or common law are excluded to
    the fullest extent permitted by law.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall be responsible for ensuring that, except to the extent
    that instructions as to the use or sale of the Equipment are contained in
    the packaging or labelling of the Equipment, any sale of the Equipment by
    the Partner is in compliance with all applicable statutory requirements and
    that handling and sale of the Equipment by the Partner is carried out in
    accordance with directions given by Plan or any competent governmental or
    regulatory authority. The Partner shall observe all reasonable directions
    and instructions given to the Partner by Plan in relation to the promotion
    and advertisement of the Equipment and shall not make any written statement
    as to the quality or manufacture of the Equipment without the prior written
    approval of Plan. The Partner will indemnify Plan against any liability loss
    or damage which Plan might suffer as a result of the Partner’s failure to
    comply with this condition.
  </li>
  <li>
    The warranties contained in this clause 7 may be assigned by the Partner to
    Customers (where the Partner resells the Equipment), subject to compliance
    by the Customers with the provisions of the relevant Customer Contract and
    subject to any limitations on the warranties specified in this clause and
    the Agreement. To the fullest extent permissible by Law, Plan shall have no
    other liability to end customers except as set out in these warranties.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>8. Returns</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    All returns of Equipment shall be subject to the Hardware Returns Policy of
    Plan or the relevant manufacturer or supplier.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan or its supplier will test all returned Equipment to ascertain whether
    it is faulty. Plan will accept returns of Equipment only if that Equipment
    is faulty. Plan will not accept the return of any Equipment if the purchaser
    has a change of mind.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall not be entitled to return any Equipment to Plan without
    Plan’s prior written consent. Such consent may be conditional on the payment
    of a handling charge (unless the Equipment was defective when delivered) and
    the Equipment being as fit for sale on their return as they were on
    delivery.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan shall have no liability to the Partner in the event that Equipment
    supplied by Plan to the Partner is faulty or defective at any time after the
    date that is 14 days after the date of delivery of such Equipment to the
    Partner. The Partner will need to deal directly with the original equipment
    manufacturer of the Equipment and rely upon the terms of any manufacturer
    warranty supplied (if any) with the Equipment.
  </li>
</ol>

<h5>9. Liability and Remedies</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    The provisions of clause 19 of the Agreement apply to each Equipment
    Contract entered into under the Agreement.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>10. Hardware Returns Policy</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    Plan’s hardware returns policy and the procedures for returning Equipment to
    Plan are set out on the Portal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner must inform the Customer that:
    <ol>
      <li>
        The Customer must be in a position to exchange the faulty device (in
        respect of Mobile Equipment, handset and battery only) for the
        replacement, at the time the replacement device is delivered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where possible, a new or refurbished device of the same type will be
        provided, but this cannot be guaranteed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the Customer’s device cannot be replaced with the same make and
        model, Plan will endeavour to ship out a device with a similar
        specification.
      </li>
      <li>
        In respect of Mobile Equipment, recite the positioning statement (as set
        out in Paragraph 2 of the Annex to this Part C) to the Customer.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Annex to Mobile Equipment Terms</h5>

<h5>1. Fault Diagnosis</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    Check that the Customer has the latest operating system installed on the
    device – please check the device user guide;
  </li>
  <li>
    Process a factory reset and remove any third-party applications. As more and
    more users install third-party applications on their devices, the chances of
    a conflict between software installed on the device increases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check with O2 technical support team or network services team to ensure the
    device is registering on the O2 network.
  </li>
  <li>
    Switch the device off and clean the SIM and battery by wiping with a clean
    cloth. Switch the device back on and see whether this resolves the issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    For dropped calls, note the location and see whether other O2 users are
    experiencing the same problem. Also, check the signal shown on the device
    and the coverage in the area via the O2 coverage checker at
    <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker" target="_blank"
      >http://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker</a
    >
    as there may be maintenance being carried out.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try the SIM in a device that works and a SIM that works in the ‘faulty’
    device - this may highlight a faulty SIM.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the device is not holding charge, let the battery run low and then using
    a mains charger rather than a USB cable attached to a laptop or PC recharge
    the device. In most cases, this will rectify the issue - if it doesn’t,
    please replace the battery.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check the device manufacturer’s website as other users may have experienced
    the same fault and a solution may be logged on the site.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check that the customer has not dropped or damaged the phone (including
    water damage).
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>2. Positioning Statement Script</h5>
<p>
  The following script should be used whenever a Customer wishes to return a
  faulty piece of Mobile Equipment:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    We will raise an order for a replacement device so that you’re not without a
    functioning phone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before I do that can you confirm that the device has not been dropped,
    damaged or had exposure to water as none of these are covered under your
    warranty.
  </li>
  <li>
    That’s great to hear because there may be a charge for the replacement if it
    was found to have been damaged upon its return.
  </li>
  <li>
    So I’ll be replacing a XXX (Make and Model) and the IMEI ends in XXX (last 3
    numbers).
  </li>
  <li>
    Upon delivery the courier will collect the faulty device we’ve just
    discussed. If for any reason you can’t provide the phone they will be unable
    to leave the replacement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> If the device is found to have been dropped,
    damaged or had exposure to water you may be charged for the cost price of
    the device.
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you please confirm the delivery address and date that best works for
    you?
  </li>
</ol>
