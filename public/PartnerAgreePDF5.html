<h5>10. Hardware Returns Policy</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    Plan’s hardware returns policy and the procedures for returning Equipment to
    Plan are set out on the Portal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner must inform the Customer that:
    <ol>
      <li>
        The Customer must be in a position to exchange the faulty device (in
        respect of Mobile Equipment, handset and battery only) for the
        replacement, at the time the replacement device is delivered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where possible, a new or refurbished device of the same type will be
        provided, but this cannot be guaranteed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the Customer’s device cannot be replaced with the same make and
        model, Plan will endeavour to ship out a device with a similar
        specification.
      </li>
      <li>
        In respect of Mobile Equipment, recite the positioning statement (as set
        out in Paragraph 2 of the Annex to this Part C) to the Customer.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Annex to Mobile Equipment Terms</h5>

<h5>1. Fault Diagnosis</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    Check that the Customer has the latest operating system installed on the
    device – please check the device user guide;
  </li>
  <li>
    Process a factory reset and remove any third-party applications. As more and
    more users install third-party applications on their devices, the chances of
    a conflict between software installed on the device increases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check with O2 technical support team or network services team to ensure the
    device is registering on the O2 network.
  </li>
  <li>
    Switch the device off and clean the SIM and battery by wiping with a clean
    cloth. Switch the device back on and see whether this resolves the issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    For dropped calls, note the location and see whether other O2 users are
    experiencing the same problem. Also, check the signal shown on the device
    and the coverage in the area via the O2 coverage checker at
    <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker" target="_blank"
      >http://www.o2.co.uk/coveragechecker</a
    >
    as there may be maintenance being carried out.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try the SIM in a device that works and a SIM that works in the ‘faulty’
    device - this may highlight a faulty SIM.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the device is not holding charge, let the battery run low and then using
    a mains charger rather than a USB cable attached to a laptop or PC recharge
    the device. In most cases, this will rectify the issue - if it doesn’t,
    please replace the battery.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check the device manufacturer’s website as other users may have experienced
    the same fault and a solution may be logged on the site.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check that the customer has not dropped or damaged the phone (including
    water damage).
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>2. Positioning Statement Script</h5>
<p>
  The following script should be used whenever a Customer wishes to return a
  faulty piece of Mobile Equipment:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    We will raise an order for a replacement device so that you’re not without a
    functioning phone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before I do that can you confirm that the device has not been dropped,
    damaged or had exposure to water as none of these are covered under your
    warranty.
  </li>
  <li>
    That’s great to hear because there may be a charge for the replacement if it
    was found to have been damaged upon its return.
  </li>
  <li>
    So I’ll be replacing a XXX (Make and Model) and the IMEI ends in XXX (last 3
    numbers).
  </li>
  <li>
    Upon delivery the courier will collect the faulty device we’ve just
    discussed. If for any reason you can’t provide the phone they will be unable
    to leave the replacement.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> If the device is found to have been dropped,
    damaged or had exposure to water you may be charged for the cost price of
    the device.
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you please confirm the delivery address and date that best works for
    you?
  </li>
</ol>

    the Purchase Price of Equipment, Plan may Clawback some or all of that
    payment in accordance with the following paragraphs.
  </li>

  <li>
    No further Commission shall be due or payable to the Partner and Plan may
    Clawback all Commission paid in respect of each and every Connection which:
    <ol>
      <li>
        is Disconnected as a consequence of Fraud by the Partner or the fraud or
        suspected fraud by the Customer;
      </li>
      <li>

        written consent of Plan.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Subject to paragraph 7 (Churn), if any Connection which is In Contract is
    Disconnected for any reason other than those listed in paragraphs 6.2.a to
    6.2.f above, no further Commission shall be due or payable to the Partner
    and Plan may Clawback an amount of Commission which is calculated pro rata
    to the unexpired portion of the Minimum Term of the relevant Customer
    Contract.
  </li>

  <li>
    If the Agreement is terminated pursuant to clause 24.3, no further
    Commission shall be due or payable to the Partner and Plan may Clawback all
    Commission paid.
  </li>

  <li>
    The Partner acknowledges and agrees that the exercise of any right of
    Clawback by Plan shall create an independent debt obligation of the Partner
    which is payable against an invoice issued by Plan to the Partner.
  </li>

  <li>
    If, following the exercise of any Clawback rights pursuant to this
    Agreement, Plan subsequently receives any amount (including, but not limited
    to a Termination Fee) from the Customer then provided that:
    <ol>
      <li>
        the Partner has provided Plan with a reasonable degree of effort and

      <li>
        Plan has achieved the expected level of revenue and profit it would have
        received had the relevant Connection run its full term,
      </li>
    </ol>

    received from the Customer up to a maximum amount equal to the amount of the
    Clawback in question.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>7. Churn</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    For the purpose of this paragraph 7, the "Churn Percentage" shall be
    calculated by:
    <ol>
      <li>
        taking the total number of Disconnections during the relevant Quarter
        and dividing that sum by the Average Base; and
      </li>
      <li>multiplying the result by 100.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    When used in paragraph 7.1, "Average Base" for the relevant Quarter means:
    <ol>
      <li>
        the total base of Connections on the first day of the relevant Quarter
        plus the total base of Connections on the last day of the relevant
        Quarter;
      </li>
      <li>divided by 2.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event that the Partner’s Churn Percentage exceeds fifteen (15.00%)
    per cent during any Quarter then Plan shall have the right to:
    <ol>
      <li>
        terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Partner on the grounds
        that a material breach of the Agreement has occurred;
      </li>
      <li>

        of transferring management of that Customer to Plan or another Partner.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event that the Churn Percentage exceeds ten (10.00%) per cent during
    any Quarter then Plan shall have the right to:
    <ol>
      <li>
        reduce the future payment of any Deferred Commission and Revenue Share
        Percentage by half until such time as the Churn Percentage is at or
        below the limit set out in this paragraph 7.4; and/or
      </li>
      <li>
        Clawback an amount of Commission equal to the Churn Percentage
        multiplied by the amount paid to the Partner as Commission in respect of
        the 12-month period prior to any Quarter in which the Churn Percentage
        is above the limit set out in this paragraph 7.4.
      </li>

  <li>
    When calculating the Churn Percentage and then exercising its rights under
    this paragraph 7, Plan will take into consideration any forecasted or
    special terms agreed in writing by a director of Plan 30 days in advance of
    the anticipated Churn Percentage. When considering exercising its rights
    under this paragraph 7 and in the absence of any pre-agreed forecast or
    special terms, Plan may, but is not obliged to, give consideration to any
    circumstances that the Partner raises with Plan as being contributory
    factors to the level of Churn Percentage along with the degree of effort
    evidenced by the Partner to retain the Customer prior to its Disconnection.

    Plan (the “Activity”). The Activity shall be carried out in accordance with
    the terms of this Schedule and the Agreement including but not limited to
    the Sales and Verification Script, which may be amended by Plan from time to
    time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall be entitled to promote, market and advertise Plan Services
    to Potential Customers within the United Kingdom during the term of the
    Agreement, via live telesales activity from suitable call centres only once:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Plan has approved the Partner’s proposed telesales activity and the
        Partner’s call centres; and
      </li>
      <li>has notified the Partner that it may do so.</li>
      <li>
        Such approval may be conditional upon the Partner undergoing such
        training as may be required by Plan as set out on the Portal.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The approval granted under paragraph 2 above shall continue in force unless

        the Partner Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; or
      </li>
      <li>
        approval is withdrawn, terminated or suspended by Plan at any time by
        Plan giving 30 days’ notice to the Partner; or

    Portal to the Commission offered by Plan to Partner for acquiring a
    Customer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan shall not be liable to pay any Commission when the transfer involves a
    consumer, and not a UK business, or an In Contract Customer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Save for manifest error, in the event of a dispute between the parties about
    the Commissions due by Plan to Partner, Plan’s own records, including but

    <ol>
      <li>remains abreast of Plan’s latest policies and Services; and</li>
      <li>

        the General Conditions of Entitlement and any Ofcom’s guidelines, the
        Data Protection Act 1998 and any direct marketing applicable

  <li>
    Partner shall provide to Plan any reasonable information requested by Plan
    about Partner’s training activities and programmes connected to the Activity

  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Annex 1 - Sales Acquisition Process</h5>
<p>Partner shall follow the steps below during the Activity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The Partner call centre(s) shall be pre-approved by Plan to carry out the
    Activity targeting Potential Customers.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner will use the Partner’s own customer databases for the telesales
    activities. These databases shall be compliant with all Applicable Laws and
    be used in accordance with any applicable legislation, regulations, and
    codes of practice, including but not limited to any applicable data
    protection and direct marketing regulations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives will follow the Verification and Sales Script and
    the procedure below for each marketing call they make to Potential Customers
    that relates to Mobile Services:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Partner’s representative will introduce themselves in accordance with
        the Sales and Verification Script and will request further information
        from the Potential Customer to assess their needs and to confirm whether
        the Potential Customer is already receiving any telecoms services from
        existing suppliers.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the event that the Potential Customer is already an In Contract
        Customer, then Partner will politely discontinue the call and
        immediately advise Plan that such a call has occurred, identifying in
        writing the Potential Customer and providing a written explanation of
        how the Potential Customer’s details were obtained.
      </li>
      <li>
        Partner’s representative will access the Portal using the username &
        password allocated by Plan for the use of Partner’s representatives and
        will carry out a live sales analysis on the spot, viewing Plan’s current
        offers for new customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the Potential Customer agrees to become a customer of Plan, then the
        Potential Customer must contact their incumbent mobile services provider
        to acquire their PAC Code. Once the Customer has provided that PAC Code
        to the Partner, the Partner’s representative will then, to the extent
        not already completed, populate the new Customer record on the Portal.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    All Potential Customer telesales calls will be verified by the Partner’s
    verification team (the “Post Sales Team”) in accordance with the Sales and
    Verification Scripts. The Post Sales Team shall be independent from the
    Partner’s sales representatives making the sales calls. A member of the Post
    Sales Team will check all the key details of the Potential Customer’s order
    in a call with the Potential Customer before proceeding and will call the
    Potential Customer again if required. All calls to Potential Customers or to
    Customers shall be recorded in accordance with the Partner’s obligations,
    more particularly as set out in paragraph 3.1.v. The sale or verification
    calls to Potential Customers or to Customers may also be verified by Plan at
    its sole discretion.
  </li>
  <li>
    A member of the Post Sales Team will carry out a number of checks on the
    Potential Customer, including but not limited to credit checks, and will
    check whether the Potential Customer is an In Contract Customer or a
    consumer and if there are any compliance issues associated with the
    telesale.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the Post Sales Team is satisfied that the Activity has been conducted
    according to the terms of this Addendum, the Partner will upload the
    verification call to the Portal and will submit the Order to Plan for
    approval and subsequent connection in accordance with the standard
    procedures of Plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    A member of Plan’s verification team may check the information uploaded by
    Partner’s representative in the Portal or available elsewhere, for each new
    Potential Customer (e.g. The Sale and Verification Calls) to verify that the
    sales process was carried out in compliance with the Sales and Verification
    Script and with Plan’s instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event that the sales process carried out by Partner’s representative
    fails to pass Partner’s own verification check, Partner will send an email
    notification to Plan with the Contract ID of the Potential Customer
    explaining the reasons why the sales process is not compliant and needs to
    be rectified or why the Potential Customer is rejected. If the Potential
    Customer is also rejected by Plan then the process finishes and Partner will
    not be entitled to a Commission.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Potential Customer is not rejected by Plan and failures can be
    rectified, then Partner will then take the necessary steps to rectify the
    issues and upload new Sale and Verification Calls (if applicable) using the
    same Contract ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event that the sales process carried out by Partner’s representative
    fails to pass Partner or Plan’s reasonable verification check again and it
    is possible to resolve the issues then Paragraph 7 above will be applied
    again.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the information uploaded by Partner’s representative passes Partner
    verification check (and Plan’s verification check if applicable), then Plan
    will send to the new Customer within 48 hours an email confirming the verbal
    agreement reached between the new Customer and the Partner representative
    during the telesales and attaching a welcome letter, the standard terms and
    conditions of the Customer Contract and confirmation of the direct debit
    instruction placed. The contents of the email will confirm the package
    ordered by the new Customer and all the terms that were outlined during the
    sales and verification process to give the Customer total reassurance during
    the transfer of his/her service to Plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Potential Customer will become a new Customer and will be activated,
    unless the new Customer or Plan cancels the order before activation. In that
    case, Partner will not be entitled to the Commission.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, Partner’s representative will
    upload all verification calls on the Portal as part of each Order.
  </li>
</ol>
