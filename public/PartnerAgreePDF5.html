<h5>6. Clawback</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    In the event that Plan has accrued an obligation to make, or has previously
    made a payment of Commission (whether Upfront Commission, Deferred
    Commission, Revenue Share Percentage or any other payment) to the Partner
    and whether or not that payment was accrued, made in cash or applied against
    the Purchase Price of Equipment, Plan may Clawback some or all of that
    payment in accordance with the following paragraphs.
  </li>

  <li>
    No further Commission shall be due or payable to the Partner and Plan may
    Clawback all Commission paid in respect of each and every Connection which:
    <ol>
      <li>
        is Disconnected as a consequence of Fraud by the Partner or the fraud or
        suspected fraud by the Customer;
      </li>
      <li>
        is Disconnected as a consequence of Churn and the Churn Percentage
        exceeds the threshold set out in paragraph 7.4 below;
      </li>

        unacceptable payment methods;
      </li>
      <li>
        Plan has issued a credit or made a payment to a Customer as a result of
        an act or omission of the Partner;
      </li>

        written consent of Plan.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Subject to paragraph 7 (Churn), if any Connection which is In Contract is
    Disconnected for any reason other than those listed in paragraphs 6.2.a to
    6.2.f above, no further Commission shall be due or payable to the Partner
    and Plan may Clawback an amount of Commission which is calculated pro rata

    If, following the exercise of any Clawback rights pursuant to this
    Agreement, Plan subsequently receives any amount (including, but not limited

        the Partner has provided Plan with a reasonable degree of effort and
        assistance; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Plan has achieved the expected level of revenue and profit it would have
        received had the relevant Connection run its full term,
      </li>
    </ol>
    then Plan shall reimburse the Partner an amount equal to that amount
    received from the Customer up to a maximum amount equal to the amount of the
    Clawback in question.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>7. Churn</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    For the purpose of this paragraph 7, the "Churn Percentage" shall be
    calculated by:
    <ol>

        taking the total number of Disconnections during the relevant Quarter
        and dividing that sum by the Average Base; and
      </li>
      <li>multiplying the result by 100.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    When used in paragraph 7.1, "Average Base" for the relevant Quarter means:
    <ol>
      <li>
        the total base of Connections on the first day of the relevant Quarter
        plus the total base of Connections on the last day of the relevant
        Quarter;
      </li>
      <li>divided by 2.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event that the Partner’s Churn Percentage exceeds fifteen (15.00%)
    per cent during any Quarter then Plan shall have the right to:
    <ol>
      <li>
        terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Partner on the grounds
        that a material breach of the Agreement has occurred;
      </li>
      <li>
        exercise its rights under paragraph 6 above to Clawback any and all

        of transferring management of that Customer to Plan or another Partner.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event that the Churn Percentage exceeds ten (10.00%) per cent during
    any Quarter then Plan shall have the right to:
    <ol>
      <li>
        reduce the future payment of any Deferred Commission and Revenue Share
        Percentage by half until such time as the Churn Percentage is at or
        below the limit set out in this paragraph 7.4; and/or
      </li>
      <li>
        Clawback an amount of Commission equal to the Churn Percentage
        multiplied by the amount paid to the Partner as Commission in respect of
        the 12-month period prior to any Quarter in which the Churn Percentage
        is above the limit set out in this paragraph 7.4.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    When calculating the Churn Percentage and then exercising its rights under
    this paragraph 7, Plan will take into consideration any forecasted or
    special terms agreed in writing by a director of Plan 30 days in advance of
    the anticipated Churn Percentage. When considering exercising its rights
    under this paragraph 7 and in the absence of any pre-agreed forecast or
    special terms, Plan may, but is not obliged to, give consideration to any
    circumstances that the Partner raises with Plan as being contributory
    factors to the level of Churn Percentage along with the degree of effort
    evidenced by the Partner to retain the Customer prior to its Disconnection.

      <li>remains abreast of Plan’s latest policies and Services; and</li>
      <li>
        complies at all times with all applicable legal requirements (including

        the General Conditions of Entitlement and any Ofcom’s guidelines, the
        Data Protection Act 1998 and any direct marketing applicable

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner shall provide to Plan any reasonable information requested by Plan
    about Partner’s training activities and programmes connected to the Activity

  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Annex 1 - Sales Acquisition Process</h5>
<p>Partner shall follow the steps below during the Activity:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The Partner call centre(s) shall be pre-approved by Plan to carry out the
    Activity targeting Potential Customers.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner will use the Partner’s own customer databases for the telesales
    activities. These databases shall be compliant with all Applicable Laws and
    be used in accordance with any applicable legislation, regulations, and
    codes of practice, including but not limited to any applicable data
    protection and direct marketing regulations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives will follow the Verification and Sales Script and
    the procedure below for each marketing call they make to Potential Customers
    that relates to Mobile Services:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Partner’s representative will introduce themselves in accordance with
        the Sales and Verification Script and will request further information
        from the Potential Customer to assess their needs and to confirm whether
        the Potential Customer is already receiving any telecoms services from
        existing suppliers.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the event that the Potential Customer is already an In Contract
        Customer, then Partner will politely discontinue the call and
        immediately advise Plan that such a call has occurred, identifying in
        writing the Potential Customer and providing a written explanation of
        how the Potential Customer’s details were obtained.
      </li>
      <li>
        Partner’s representative will access the Portal using the username &
        password allocated by Plan for the use of Partner’s representatives and
        will carry out a live sales analysis on the spot, viewing Plan’s current
        offers for new customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the Potential Customer agrees to become a customer of Plan, then the
        Potential Customer must contact their incumbent mobile services provider
        to acquire their PAC Code. Once the Customer has provided that PAC Code
        to the Partner, the Partner’s representative will then, to the extent
        not already completed, populate the new Customer record on the Portal.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    All Potential Customer telesales calls will be verified by the Partner’s
    verification team (the “Post Sales Team”) in accordance with the Sales and
    Verification Scripts. The Post Sales Team shall be independent from the
    Partner’s sales representatives making the sales calls. A member of the Post
    Sales Team will check all the key details of the Potential Customer’s order
    in a call with the Potential Customer before proceeding and will call the
    Potential Customer again if required. All calls to Potential Customers or to
    Customers shall be recorded in accordance with the Partner’s obligations,
    more particularly as set out in paragraph 3.1.v. The sale or verification
    calls to Potential Customers or to Customers may also be verified by Plan at
    its sole discretion.
  </li>
  <li>
    A member of the Post Sales Team will carry out a number of checks on the
    Potential Customer, including but not limited to credit checks, and will
    check whether the Potential Customer is an In Contract Customer or a
    consumer and if there are any compliance issues associated with the
    telesale.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the Post Sales Team is satisfied that the Activity has been conducted
    according to the terms of this Addendum, the Partner will upload the
    verification call to the Portal and will submit the Order to Plan for
    approval and subsequent connection in accordance with the standard
    procedures of Plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    A member of Plan’s verification team may check the information uploaded by
    Partner’s representative in the Portal or available elsewhere, for each new
    Potential Customer (e.g. The Sale and Verification Calls) to verify that the
    sales process was carried out in compliance with the Sales and Verification
    Script and with Plan’s instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event that the sales process carried out by Partner’s representative
    fails to pass Partner’s own verification check, Partner will send an email
    notification to Plan with the Contract ID of the Potential Customer
    explaining the reasons why the sales process is not compliant and needs to
    be rectified or why the Potential Customer is rejected. If the Potential
    Customer is also rejected by Plan then the process finishes and Partner will
    not be entitled to a Commission.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Potential Customer is not rejected by Plan and failures can be
    rectified, then Partner will then take the necessary steps to rectify the
    issues and upload new Sale and Verification Calls (if applicable) using the
    same Contract ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event that the sales process carried out by Partner’s representative
    fails to pass Partner or Plan’s reasonable verification check again and it
    is possible to resolve the issues then Paragraph 7 above will be applied
    again.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the information uploaded by Partner’s representative passes Partner
    verification check (and Plan’s verification check if applicable), then Plan
    will send to the new Customer within 48 hours an email confirming the verbal
    agreement reached between the new Customer and the Partner representative
    during the telesales and attaching a welcome letter, the standard terms and
    conditions of the Customer Contract and confirmation of the direct debit
    instruction placed. The contents of the email will confirm the package
    ordered by the new Customer and all the terms that were outlined during the
    sales and verification process to give the Customer total reassurance during
    the transfer of his/her service to Plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Potential Customer will become a new Customer and will be activated,
    unless the new Customer or Plan cancels the order before activation. In that
    case, Partner will not be entitled to the Commission.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, Partner’s representative will
    upload all verification calls on the Portal as part of each Order.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Annex 2</h5>

<h5>Sales Compliance Policy</h5>

<h5>Compliance Overview</h5>
<p>
  This Annex details a series of compliance measures that Partner shall follow
  to comply with the applicable legislation and with Ofcom’s General Conditions
  of Entitlement, to eliminate bad sales practice, protect good sales practice
  and address any potential allegations promptly and professionally. Plan takes
  a stringent stance on sales compliance and on the adherence to Ofcom General
  Conditions of Entitlement and guidelines.
</p>

<h5>Compliance Feedback Process</h5>
<p>
  Partner shall fully assist Plan in the investigation of any compliance issue
  against Plan or Partner or any members of its staff.
</p>
<p>
  If during a verification call or otherwise, the Post Sale Team or any member
  of staff of Partner finds any compliance issues, Partner shall promptly (and,
  in any event, within 2 Business Days from finding/being aware of any
  compliance issue) start an investigation and will report any compliance issues
  to Plan immediately in writing.
</p>
<p>
  Plan shall be, periodically (at least every 7 days) and within 1 Business Day
  of Plan’s request, kept informed of any progress made during the investigation
  of the relevant compliance issues. Once the investigation is finalised,
  Partner will communicate the result of the investigation to Plan by email or
  letter by the appropriate member of staff. The priority for the Partner shall
  be to resolve any issue to the Potential Customer or to the new Customer’s
  satisfaction and to fully resolve any compliance issues in a timely manner.
  Plan shall have the authority under this agreement to conduct its own
  investigation into a complaint of non-compliance.
</p>

<h5>Agent’s Code of Conduct</h5>
<p>
  This code details what Partners must adhere to whilst representing Plan and it
  is a condition of the Agreement:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Partner’s representative will immediately and truthfully identify themselves
    to Potential Customers. The Potential Customer should be aware that
    Partner’s representative is working on behalf of Plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives must explain that Plan, in relation to Mobile
    Services, is an independent telecoms service provider utilising O2’s network
    and clearly advise the Potential Customer that the Potential Customer will:
    <ol>
      <li>
        be contracting with Plan for the Services and receive their bill from
        Plan; and
      </li>
      <li>receive customer services support from Plan.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives must at all times be courteous and professional.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives must seek to avoid the Potential Customer
    misunderstanding any information given or making false assumptions, in
    particular with regard to savings. They must offer only factual and accurate
    information about Plan Services and contracts.
  </li>
  <li>Partner’s representatives must not use high-pressure sales tactics.</li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives must ask for sufficient appropriate information in
    order to verify that the Customer is the account holder, such as telephone
    number, address and postcode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives must follow the verification call process
    specified in the Scripts or in any other documentation approved by Plan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives must maintain records, including date and
    approximate time of contact with the Customer, and must upload them to Plan
    Portal and make them available to Plan promptly at any time for a minimum
    period of 37 months, to facilitate the recovery of the Sales and
    Verification Calls and to allow identification of Partner’s representative
    in the event of a compliance issue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives must ensure that the person signing the contract
    or entering into a Customer Contract is duly authorised to do so and that
    they fully understand the terms and conditions of the contract.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representatives must ensure that they have made an informed
    judgement whether the Potential Customer:
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Is able to fully understand English;</li>
    <li>
      Is paying attention, and therefore understands that he/she has consented
      to the contract; or
    </li>
    <li>
      Is hard of hearing and may not be fully aware that they are consenting to
      a contract.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>
    Partner’s representative must explain the nature of all the essential
    provisions of the Customer Contract, so as to ensure that as far as possible
    the Potential Customer understands what they are committing themselves to.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partner’s representative must take all reasonable steps to ensure the
    Potential Customer has understood that, amongst other things:
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>
      They have entered into a contract for Plan to take over his/her mobile
      services.
    </li>
    <li>The relevant Tariff; and</li>
    <li>Implications of cancelling the contract, and early termination.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>
    Partner should only call on businesses at times appropriate to that business
    (i.e. telesales must not take place at an unreasonable time of day, say
    before 8.00am and after 8.00pm, unless the customer requests otherwise).
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Sanctions</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    In the event that Partner breaches this sales compliance policy or any of
    its compliance obligations under this Schedule 4 (the “Compliance
    Obligations”), Plan shall, without prejudice to any remedies available to
    Plan under the Agreement, be entitled to:
    <ol>
      <li>give verbal or written warnings to Partner;</li>
      <li>
        require the Partner to prevent further breaches in the future, and to
        fully remedy any breach of the Compliance Obligations immediately; or
      </li>
      <li>
        in the event of repeated breaches of the Compliance Obligations by the
        Partner (i.e. in more than three occasions during a period of 12
        months), Plan shall be entitled to terminate this Schedule 4
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Annex 3</h5>
<h5>Partner Representations and Scripts</h5>

<h6>1. Partner represents that:</h6>
<ol>
  <li>
    it will not actively be approaching any customer connected, directly or
    indirectly, to O2 or In Contract Customers.
  </li>
  <li>
    O2 network migrations (i.e. end users already directly or indirectly
    connected to the O2 network) shall make up no more than 10% of all Customers
    acquired by the Partner under the Activity in any given quarter.
  </li>
  <li>
    it will sell Plan Services to the SoHo Market through a distance selling
    model based in live telesales activity from Partner’s call centre.
  </li>
  <li>
    90% of Customer Connections generated from the Activity will be connections
    ported from other mobile communication providers (excluding O2). This
    therefore means 90% of Customer Connections transferred by Partner to Plan
    will have a track record of having paid their bills for a minimum of 24
    months.
  </li>
</ol>

<h6>
  To ensure that the Partner is compliant with OFCOM regulations, specifically
  GC23, the Partner Warrants and Represents that in conducting the Activity, its
  sales and verification scripts adhere to the following:
</h6>

<h6>Sales Scripts</h6>
<ol>
  <li>
    Sales scripts must require any person calling on your company’s behalf to
    clearly identify themselves and your company to the prospective customer —
    it must be made clear that you are an authorised partner of plan.com and
    that you are not calling on plan.com’s or O2’s behalf (it is acceptable to
    say that plan.com is powered by O2 or utilises the O2 network, but you must
    ensure that the customer is fully aware they will be contracting with
    plan.com).
  </li>
  <li>
    Sales scripts must confirm that you are speaking to the Account Holder.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must take reasonable steps to ensure that the customer is aware that
    calls are being recorded. This can be on the inbound IVR, on outbound calls
    or in documented terms and conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sales scripts must include the monthly fee (ensuring it is clear that the
    fee is including/excluding VAT) and what’s included in the plan in terms of
    calls, texts, voicemail and data. Details of additional products and

    is used and that the customer will have adequate coverage for their intended
    use.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sales scripts must ensure that the EE coverage checker at
    <a href="https://coverage.ee.co.uk">Coverage Checker</a> is used and that
    the customer will have adequate coverage for their intended use.
  </li>
  <li>
    It must be made clear to the customer that they would be entering into a new
    contract and the length and start date of the contract must be clearly
    stated. It should also be made clear that any early termination of the
    contract will incur an early termination fee equal to the contracted monthly
    amount multiplied by the number of months left on the contract.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sales scripts must detail key Out of Bundle charges including: calls to own
    network and other mobile networks, landlines, voicemail, texts and data. You

    <a href="http://www.plan.com/pricing.php">plan.com Pricing</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sales scripts must include a reference to the terms and conditions being
    provided in the post with the device/SIM card, including a detailed and
    clear explanation of the process the customer has to follow to obtain any
    sales incentives. It must be made clear that the incentive is directly with
    you, not plan.com or O2 and that there will be a separate contact between
    you and the customer in respect of it.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a deposit or delivery charge is applicable, this must be detailed during
    the sales call.
  </li>
  <li>
    If, during the call, the customer indicates that they have already arranged
    an upgrade with another company then it must be made clear that you are
    calling from a different company. The customer must clearly state that they
    are happy to enter into negotiations with yourselves and be aware that they
    must cancel any upgrade previously arranged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Documented sales scripts are required for all sales types performed as
    ‘telesales’ — this includes new connections, additional lines and upgrades.
    We will from time to time ask to see complete copies of your scripts and
    also take steps to ensure that they are being complied with in practice.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sales scripts must be trained to all staff as part of their induction to
    ensure all key points are clearly covered with the customer on every call.
  </li>
  <li>
    A documented and structured call monitoring process must be in place to
    ensure staff are adhering to scripts.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>Verification Scripts</h5>
<ol>
  <li>
    The Verification call should be completed by a different person to the one
    who completed the sales call (wherever possible).

    promotions should be made clear. An explanation of any fair usage policies
    or capped limits relating to the plan must also be given.

    terms that may apply.
  </li>
  <li>Verification Scripts must include the contract length and start date.</li>

  <li>
    Verification Scripts must include clear confirmation that in the event the
    customer chooses to withdraw from its contract during the 14-day cooling-off
    period, the customer will still be liable for any usage charges incurred
    during that period.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verification Scripts include a reference to the terms and conditions being
    provided in the post with the device/SIM card, including a detailed and
    clear explanation of the process the customer has to follow to obtain any
    sales incentives. It must be made clear the incentive is directly with the
    Partner, not the Network and there will be a separate contract with separate
    terms for the Incentive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verification Scripts must include clear and concise information about
    termination charges, termination rights, and procedures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Customers must be given the opportunity to view Network Terms and Conditions
    prior to positive acceptance. This can be done by directing the customer to
    the partner’s own website, the plan.com website, or emailing the customer
    directly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verification Scripts must include positive acceptance from the customer —

    the contract, are you happy to proceed?”
  </li>
  <li>

    ensure all staff are adhering to scripts.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5>DD Scripts</h5>
<p>
  This script is to be used for obtaining the
  <strong>verbal</strong> Direct Debit instruction for customers who have signed
  a plan.com service contract.
</p>

<h6>Prior to Direct Debit Conversation</h6>
<p>Assuming:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The customer has been correctly identified and/or</li>
  <li>
    The customer is happy that they are speaking to an authorised dealer
    representative or plan.com employee
  </li>
  <li>
    The customer must have been informed that all calls are recorded and may
    also be monitored for training and compliance purposes, such as establishing
    the verbal Direct Debit as below
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  … thank you, can you please confirm that you hold a UK bank or building
  society account and you are the account holder?
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If yes</strong>, proceed</li>
  <li>
    <strong>If no</strong>, notify the customer that a UK bank or building
    society account is required. Inform them that a written Direct Debit form
    will be posted. Confirm the address for sending.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Can you confirm that you are the only person required to authorise debits from
  this account?
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If yes</strong>, proceed</li>
  <li>
    <strong>If no</strong>, notify that an authorised signatory is required.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Can you confirm the name of the account you wish to be debited?</p>
<p>Take details</p>

<p>
  Can you confirm the branch sort code of the account you wish to be debited?
</p>
<p>
  Take details (if unsure, advise the customer that their cheque book will
  contain the necessary details)
</p>

<p>Can you confirm the account number of the account you wish to be debited?</p>
<p>
  Take details (if unsure, advise the customer that their cheque book will
  contain the necessary details)
</p>

<p>
  Since not all banks or building societies can accept Direct Debit
  instructions, can I ask whether this account is already used for Direct Debit
  payments to other suppliers?
</p>
<p>Apply modulus checking</p>

<p>
  Ok thanks, we are nearly there. Can I just confirm your account details back
  to you to verify they are accurate?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The account name is XXXXX, is this correct?</li>
  <li>Payer Confirms</li>
  <li>The account sort code is XX-XX-XX, is this correct?</li>
  <li>Payer Confirms</li>
  <li>The account number is XXXXXXXX, is this correct?</li>
  <li>Payer Confirms</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Excellent, thank you. Now do you require any information regarding the debits
  that will be made from your account?
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If no</strong>, proceed</li>
  <li><strong>If yes</strong>, resolve any queries regarding:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The first payment date and any subsequent payment dates</li>
    <li>The first or any subsequent payment amounts</li>
    <li>Minimum contracted values</li>
    <li>
      Out-of-bundle expenditure in excess of the minimum contracted values
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
  Ok just to inform you that the company name appearing on your bank statement
  against the amount debited will be <strong>plan.com</strong>.
</p>
<p>And that’s it, you have set up your Direct Debit instruction with us.</p>
<p>
  You will be sent confirmation of this by email no later than 10 days prior to
  the first collection.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, I just wish to advise that all Direct Debit payments are protected by
  the Direct Debit guarantee. I’m happy to read this to you now if you like, or
  alternatively you will find it in our confirmation letter, which you can then
  read at your leisure.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>If no</strong>, ask if any further assistance can be provided /
    close the call if not.
  </li>
  <li><strong>If yes</strong>, read the Direct Debit guarantee:</li>
</ul>

<h6>Direct Debit Guarantee</h6>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Direct Debit guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies
    that accept instructions to pay Direct Debits.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are any changes to the amount, date, or frequency of your Direct
    Debit, plan.com will notify you 10 working days in advance of your account
    being debited or as otherwise agreed. If you request plan.com to collect a
    payment, confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the
    time of the request.
  </li>
  <li>
    If an error is made in the payment of your Direct Debit, by plan.com or your
    bank or building society, you are entitled to a full and immediate refund of
    the amount paid from your bank or building society.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you receive a refund you are not entitled to, you must pay it back when
    plan.com asks you to.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can cancel a Direct Debit at any time by simply contacting your bank or
    building society. Written confirmation may be required. Please also notify
    us.
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Footnotes</h5>

<h6>Responses to Possible Questions (To Be Used with the Example Script)</h6>

<h6>
  If the payer asks how it is possible to set up a Direct Debit instruction over
  the phone
</h6>
<p>
  Telephone/verbal Direct Debits are an enhanced service offered by the banking
  industry which allows us to set them up over the telephone. All the normal
  safeguards of the Direct Debit guarantee still apply and we will always
  confirm the content of these calls to you in writing.
</p>

<h6>
  If the payer would prefer to use the post and receive a paper instruction for
  completion and return
</h6>
<p>
  We can arrange for a paper Direct Debit instruction to be mailed for
  completion and return to us. Is there a particular concern you have with
  setting up the Direct Debit over the phone now? Putting bank details in the
  post may in fact be a less secure method.
</p>

<h6>If the payer is not the account holder</h6>
<p>
  As you are not the account holder, we will need to send the account holder a
  Direct Debit instruction to complete and return. Can I confirm the address to
  send this to?
</p>

<h6>If the payer says he is concerned over the security information</h6>
<p>
  I can understand that, but I can assure you that all information is retained
  in the strictest of confidence. In the event that you have any queries or
  dispute an entry on your bank account you can of course rely on the Direct
  Debit guarantee. Does that ease your concerns enough to want to go ahead now?
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Yes</strong> — Go ahead with the rest of the script.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>No</strong> — Payer wants information in the post, check details and
    close politely.
  </li>
</ul>

<h6>If the payer has concerns over mistakes being made</h6>
<p>
  I understand your concern and to reduce customers' concerns a number of
  measures are in place to safeguard against genuine mistakes. There is the
  Direct Debit guarantee.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Firstly, if at any time money is debited from your account incorrectly the
    banks and building societies guarantee to refund it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Secondly, no changes to the date, frequency or amount can be made without
    notifying you normally at least 10 working days in advance of your account
    being debited.
  </li>
  <li>
    And finally, you have the right to cancel any Direct Debit at any time
    simply by writing to your bank or building society, with a copy to us.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  A copy of these safeguards will also be included in our confirmation letter.
</p>
