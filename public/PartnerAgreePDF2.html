      Agreement with the Partner and to ensure the continued distribution of the
      Services by Plan, during the Agreement and for a period of nine (9) months
      after the termination or expiry of the Agreement, the Partner agrees that it
      shall not (directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever including
      procuring or facilitating another network operator or third party to do the
      same) solicit or entice away or seek to solicit or entice any Customer or
      Potential Customer away from Plan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any breach by the Partner of clause 18.1 shall:
      <ol>
        <li>
          be a material breach which is not capable of remedy giving Plan a right
          of termination under clause 24.3(a);
        </li>
        <li>
          entitle Plan to seek any legal or equitable relief, including an
          injunction; and
        </li>
        <li>
          require the Partner to pay to Plan an amount equal to the value of the
          Customers enticed away from Plan in breach of clause 18.1, being an
          amount calculated for each Customer as follows:
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>CV = (MS + AC) x RM</strong></p>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CV</strong> = Customer Value</li>
        <li>
          <strong>MS</strong> = Monthly subscription payable by the Customer
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AC</strong> = Average additional charges paid by the Customer
          over and above MS, calculated by adding the total amount of all
          additional charges paid by the customer over and above the MS in each
          month of the term of the Customer Contract elapsed to date of
          termination and dividing the same by the number of months so elapsed
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RM</strong> = The remaining months in the Customer Contract
          following the date of termination
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      For the Duration, the Partner shall not solicit or otherwise contact
      Customers which the Partner knows or ought reasonably to know are Customers
      which either Plan manages directly or which are managed by or have been
      introduced by another Partner unless the relevant Customer has given prior
      written authorisation by letter and Plan has given its prior written
      consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
    </li>
    <li>
      Subject to clauses 18.5 and 18.6, the Partner shall be responsible for
      managing the Partner Handled Customers and, save to the extent necessary to
      provide and manage the Services and save to the extent set out in this
      Agreement, Plan shall not contact or market directly to any of the Partner
      Handled Customers.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Partner shall inform Plan of information about, communications with, and
      instructions from each of the Partner Handled Customers which directly or
      indirectly impact the provision of the Services to that Partner Handled
      Customer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Nothing in the Agreement shall prevent Plan from:
      <ol>
        <li>providing Services directly to a Partner Handled Customer where:</li>
        <li>
          a Partner Handled Customer directly approaches Plan for the provision of
          any or all of the Services and Plan, in its reasonable opinion, decides
          the Partner is either unable, incapable or unwilling to provide any or
          all of the Services or the Customer no longer wishes to deal directly
          with the Partner for any or all of the Services; or
        </li>
        <li>
          Plan is entitled under clause 25.2(e) to transfer management of the
          Partner Handled Customer to Plan;
        </li>
  
        <li>
          sending general marketing information and promotional material to a
          Partner Handled Customer as part of a bona fide general marketing
          campaign to Customers where Plan has not specifically targeted the
          Partner Handled Customer; or
        </li>
        <li>
          contacting and communicating with Customers for purposes other than
          sales, including conducting Customer Satisfaction Surveys.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>19. Limitations on Liability</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Nothing in the Agreement shall limit or exclude either the Partner’s or

      negligence or for any liability which cannot be lawfully excluded.
    </li>
    <li>
      Except as specified in the Agreement, all warranties, terms, and conditions
      are expressly excluded to the maximum permitted by Applicable Laws.
    </li>
    <li>
      Subject to clause 19.1 (Limitations on Liability) and except as expressly
      provided in the Agreement, Plan shall not be liable to the Partner for any:
      <ol>
        <li>loss of profit;</li>
        <li>loss of business;</li>
        <li>loss of revenue;</li>

        <li>any other direct or indirect or consequential loss.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Subject to clauses 19.1 and 19.3 and excluding payment obligations expressed
      in the Agreement, Plan’s total liability under the Agreement (including
      Plan’s liability to the Partner as a result of Plan’s deliberate breach of
      the Agreement) shall be limited in any Year to the lesser of:
      <ol>
        <li>the sum of fifty thousand pounds (£50,000); or</li>
        <li>
          the amount of Commission payable by Plan to the Partner for the
          immediately preceding six (6) months from the event forming the subject
          matter of a claim (or if a series of events then the first event)
          occurred.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>20. Sub-Contracting</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The Partner shall not use sub-contractors, sub-distributors, or sub-agents
      (together "Sub-contractors") to promote and market the Services unless Plan
      has given its prior written consent. The Partner acknowledges that it shall
      be a condition of Plan’s consent in respect of this clause 20.1
      (Sub-Contracting) that the Partner must show that the proposed
      Sub-contractor:
      <ol>
        <li>
          is of good financial standing (by having sufficient financial resources
          to be able to perform its obligations and meet its liabilities under the
          written agreement referred to in sub-clause 20.1.2); and
        </li>
        <li>
          has entered into a written agreement with the Partner which provides no
          less protection in relation to Plan’s business than the terms of the
          Agreement and which allows Plan to enforce the terms of such agreement
          as a third-party beneficiary.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      The Partner shall provide to Plan upon request by Plan, a copy of the
      written agreement referred to in clause 20.1.2 prior to its execution for
      consideration by Plan for the purposes of clause 20.1 (Sub-Contracting).
    </li>
    <li>
      The Partner acknowledges that it shall be a condition of Plan’s consent in
      respect of clause 20.1 (Sub-Contracting) that:
      <ol>
        <li>
          any Sub-contractor shall not have the right to further sub-contract or
          sub-delegate their obligations in relation to the Services;
        </li>
        <li>
          such consent to sub-contract or delegate shall not exclude or limit the
          Partner’s obligations and liabilities under the Agreement and that the
          Partner shall remain responsible to Plan for the acts and omissions of
          the Partner’s Sub-contractors. The Partner agrees to indemnify Plan in
          respect of any loss which Plan incurs as a result of the Partner's
          appointment or termination of appointment of the Partner’s
          Sub-contractors;
        </li>
        <li>
          the Partner shall ensure that each Sub-contractor the Partner appoints
          shall be bound by obligations and restrictions which are no less onerous
          than the obligations and restrictions which apply to the Partner under
          the Agreement. Accordingly, the Partner shall ensure that its
          Sub-contractors or any other entity or individual to whom delegation of
          any of the Partner’s rights or obligations under the Agreement occurs
          comply with the provisions of the Agreement as if they were the Partner.
          The Partner shall be and remain fully responsible, in all respects, for
          all of the Services and obligations performed by any person on behalf of
          the Partner as if they had been performed by the Partner itself, and
          references to the Partner in the Agreement shall be deemed to include
          reference to such persons; and
        </li>
        <li>
          the Partner shall ensure that, if the Agreement terminates for any
          reason, the rights granted to each Sub-contractor pursuant to the
          Agreement shall immediately be terminated without limiting continuing
          obligations on them.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>21. Assignment</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Plan may assign, novate, transfer, pledge, encumber, declare a trust of the
      benefit of or in any other way alienate any of its rights or obligations
      under this Agreement whether in whole or in part to any of its Affiliates or
      any third party from time to time, without notice to the Partner.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Agreement is personal to the Partner and the Partner shall not assign,
      transfer, charge, mortgage or otherwise deal with, all or any of its rights,
      entitlements, interests, liabilities and/or obligations under the Agreement
      without the prior written consent of Plan, such consent not to be
      unreasonably withheld provided that any approved assignee agrees to be bound
      by the terms of the Agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
      This Agreement will be binding upon and inure for the benefit of the Parties
      and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h4>22. Dispute Resolution</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      If Plan has a disagreement or dispute with a Partner in relation to any
      aspect of the Agreement, they each agree to use their respective best
      endeavours to resolve the dispute within fourteen (14) days (or such shorter
      period as is reasonable in the circumstances) from the date of it being
      raised.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the Partner and Plan are unable to resolve the disagreement or dispute
      referred to in clause 22.1 within fourteen (14) days of it being raised,
      both Plan and the Partner agree that they will escalate the disagreement or
      dispute to their respective senior managers (or equivalents).
    </li>
    <li>
      If the Partner and Plan are still unable to resolve the disagreement or
      dispute referred to in clause 22.1 within thirty (30) days following
      escalation in accordance with clause 22.2, the Partner and Plan shall
      (acting in good faith) seek to agree whether the disagreement or dispute
      should be settled through mediation rather than proceedings in an English
      court. If no such agreement is reached within a further period of twenty
      (20) days or if the Parties are subsequently unable to resolve the
      disagreement or dispute through mediation, either Plan or the Partner may
      commence proceedings through the courts of England.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h4>23. Suspension</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Without prior notice to the Partner, Plan may immediately suspend the supply
      of the Services, in whole or in part, if:
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the reasonable view of Plan, the Services:
          <ol>
            <li>May pose a threat to the safety of persons;</li>
            <li>
              May pose a hazard which would impair or prevent the operation of
              equipment;
            </li>
            <li>
              May pose a threat to the proper operation, access, integrity and/or
              security of the Network; or
            </li>
            <li>
              Are likely to impede the activities of authorised persons responding
              to an emergency.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          The Partner ceases to be eligible at law and/or under regulation to
          receive the Services;
        </li>
        <li>
          The Partner fails to clearly communicate that they do not represent
          Plan, EE or O2;
        </li>
        <li>
          The Partner signs up any customer which is not a business or company;
        </li>
        <li>
          The Partner does not adhere to the compliance script provided by Plan,
          as updated from time to time;
        </li>
        <li>
          It is necessary for operational reasons such as upgrades to any of the
          Services or regular maintenance;
        </li>
        <li>It is necessary for emergency maintenance; or</li>
        <li>A Service has been affected by a Force Majeure event.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>24. Termination</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Plan may, at any time after expiry of the Initial Term and without any
      liability, terminate this Agreement by giving not less than thirty (30)
      days’ notice in writing to the Partner.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Partner may, any time after the expiry of the Initial Term, terminate
      this Agreement by giving not less than ninety (90) days’ notice in writing
      to Plan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies to which Plan may be
      entitled, Plan may with immediate effect by giving written notice to the
      Partner terminate this Agreement if:
      <ol>
        <li>
          the Partner commits or is believed by Plan (acting reasonably) to have
          committed a material breach of this Agreement which breach is not
          capable of remedy or which the Partner fails to remedy within a period
          of five (5) Business Days after being notified in writing to do so;
        </li>
        <li>
          the Partner commits three or more non-material breaches of the Agreement
          in any consecutive three (3) months, which if capable of remedy have not
          been remedied within ten (10) Business Days after being notified in

          may place Plan in breach of its agreement with a Network Operator;
        </li>
        <li>the Partner suffers an Insolvency Event; or</li>
        <li>
          the Network Operator terminates its agreement with Plan or ceases to

              reasonably practicable after commencement of the Force Majeure
