    accepted once:
    <ol>
      <li>an Order has been properly completed on the Portal;</li>
      <li>Plan can fulfil the request for Services within the Order; and</li>
      <li>

    advance notice having regard to the nature of the change.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall not at any time:
    <ol>
      <li>
        other than in the case of a Renewal, encourage Customers to terminate an

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

    The Partner shall:
    <ol>
      <li>
        ensure that the signatory details provided to Plan in respect of all
        Customer Contracts are those of authorised signatories of the Customer;
        and
      </li>
      <li>
        provide Plan with such other Customer details as may be requested by
        Plan as soon as practicable (and in any event within seven (7) days of

      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<ol>
  <li>
    For the Duration, the Partner may describe itself to third parties
    (including Customers) as a sales partner of Plan in any dealings with such
    third party concerning the Services but for the avoidance of any doubt never
    as an agent of Plan. The Partner is not permitted to enter into any
    agreements for the provision of the Services or to hold itself out as having
    the right to bind Plan in relation to any agreement for the provision of the
    Services.

    accordance with Good Industry Practice) make a reasonable assessment as to
    whether it has the requisite experience, expertise, and resources to meet
    the requirements of that prospective Customer (including whether the
    Customer is a business customer). This requirement is ongoing, and if the
    Partner becomes aware or should have become aware of the pending insolvency
    or inability of the Customer to pay its debts, the Partner should make Plan
    aware of such information as soon as reasonably practicable. If the Partner
    is unable, or in the Partner’s reasonable opinion may be unable, to meet the
    prospective Customer’s requirements, the Partner must inform Plan
    immediately of the same in writing, stating the reasons as to why it is
    unable to meet such requirements.

    The Partner is obliged to meet or exceed the following (each being a
    "Minimum Service Requirement"):
    <ol>

        respect of all Customer queries which it has been unable to resolve
        within that twenty-four (24) hour period, the Partner shall provide the
        Customer with updates within twenty-four (24) hours of the initial query
        and each subsequent twenty-four (24) hour period thereafter and shall
        successfully resolve such queries in a timely manner to the reasonable
        satisfaction of the Customer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Depending upon the Customer’s size, spend, and potential requirements,

        months) throughout the Duration.

        The Partner shall provide pre-sales and post-sales support services to
        Partner Handled Customers in a timely and professional manner and use
        all reasonable endeavours to resolve or escalate Customer issues to Plan
        Customer issues as may be necessary.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The Partner shall:

        considers could be prejudicial to its goodwill or commercial interests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not levy any charges to Potential Customers or to Customers for the use
        of the Services or otherwise unless such charges have been previously
        approved by Plan in writing.

        issues arising from its operation.

        other third party).

        Keep Customer’s records and databases safe and separate from any other
        databases containing details of the Partner’s other clients.

      </li>
      <li>
        Obtain Plan’s prior written approval for the use of any sales material
        or documentation related to the Services (particularly if such material
        or documentation contains any Intellectual Property Rights relating to
        Plan or its suppliers).
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure that the Services offered to a Potential Customer are suitable
        for the Potential Customer (e.g., the Partner will check that the

    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>
    Plan shall provide the Partner and its Authorised Users with access to the
    Portal to enable the Partner to carry out sales analysis, process orders,

    and at Plan’s absolute discretion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Plan may, upon request by the Partner, provide each Authorised User with a
    username and the facility to create and manage a password.
  </li>

    certification and/or accreditation requirements relating to any of the

    forward for reconciliation in the following invoice.

  <li>
    Subject to clause 8.9, the Partner shall not be entitled to apply any
    set-off, counterclaim, abatement, deduction, or withholding (other than any
    deduction or withholding of tax as required by law) or claim the same in

    other agreement between the Parties against any sums that Plan owes to the
    Partner under the Agreement.

            Plan on the due date for payment, provided that Plan shall notify
            the Partner of any such payment, whereupon the Partner shall pay to
            Plan an amount equal to the sum paid out of the Security Deposit;

    machine-readable, visual, electronic (including magnetic or digital), or any
    other form) ("Records"). The Records shall be stored in a format required by
    Plan for a period of seven (7) years from the termination of the Agreement.

        otherwise fails to operate properly.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    At any time, upon Plan giving reasonable prior notice to the Partner (unless
    Plan believes the Partner is or is likely to be in material breach of the
    Agreement, in which case such notice shall not be required) during the
    Duration and thereafter until all the Partner’s rights, obligations, and

    with any such audit and supply promptly such information, data, and records
    (whether stored electronically or otherwise) of whatsoever nature relating
    to the Services and the Partner’s obligations under this Agreement as may be
    reasonably requested by Plan. Plan shall be entitled to make copies or take
    extracts of the same and the Partner shall provide copying facilities at no
    charge to Plan.

    regulatory compliance in relation to Customers shall be considered a
    material breach that is not capable of remedy for the purposes of clauses
    24.3(a). The Partner hereby grants to each Regulatory Body the same rights
    as those granted to Plan under this clause 12 (Records and Audits), save
